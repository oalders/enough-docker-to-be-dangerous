# Enough Docker to be Dangerous 🐳

Note:

---

## 📚 What is Docker?

Note:

* A tool for managing containers. This includes:
  * building containers
  * running containers
  * orchestrating containers
* Today we will be looking primarily at building and running containers.

---

## 📦 What is a container?

Note:

* A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of
  software that includes everything needed to run an application: code,
  runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings
* Docker images become containers at runtime

---

## 🐪 A simple use case

```text
$ docker run --rm perl:5.38 perl --version

This is perl 5, version 38, subversion 0 (v5.38.0) built for aarch64-linux-gnu
```

This uses an official image from <https://hub.docker.com/_/perl>

Note:

* run
* --rm
  * Clean up when container exits. If you're not debugging your container,
    you'll generally want `--rm` in order to avoid filling your disk with the
    file systems of your old containers.
* perl:5.38

---

## 🐫 Simple (continued)

If you get warnings about your platform, you can fix it up by specifying
a platform.

On my Mac:

```text
--platform=linux/x86_64
```

That gives us:

```text
docker run --rm --platform=linux/x86_64 perl:5.38 perl --version
```

Note:

* I started seeing these after moving to a newer Mac with Apple silicon (arm64).
* I'm going to leave this out for most of the follow examples for the sake of brevity.

---

## 💥 Running two commands

```text
docker run --rm --platform=linux/x86_64 perl:5.38 \
  perl --version && perl --version
```

Note:

* What happened here?

---

## ✅ Running two commands

```text
$ docker run --rm perl:5.38 \
  bash -c "perl --version && perl --version"
```

Note:

* This is a handy syntax if you want to do more complex things at the command line.

---

## ➕ Adding logic to your commands

```text
docker run --rm perl:5.38 bash -c \
    "cpm install -g Crypt::XkcdPassword && \
    perl -MCrypt::XkcdPassword -E \
    'say Crypt::XkcdPassword->make_password'"
```

---

### 🚚 Moving logic into a script

<!-- :read slides/8-intro-to-docker/app/pw.pl -->

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use 5.38.0;

use Crypt::XkcdPassword ();
use Term::ANSIColor     qw( color );

print color('bold blue');
say Crypt::XkcdPassword->make_password;
print color('reset');
```

Note:

* `-v` is short for `--volume`

---

### 👟 Running the script

```text
docker run --rm                                    \
    -v "$PWD:/usr/src/app"                         \
    perl:5.38                                      \
    bash -c "cpm install -g Crypt::XkcdPassword && \
    ./pw.pl"
```

---

### 🔨 Building your own images

`Dockerfile`:

 <!-- :read slides/8-intro-to-docker/app/Dockerfile  -->

```Dockerfile
FROM perl:5.38

RUN cpm install -g Crypt::XkcdPassword
```

Note:

* `-t` is short for `--tag`

 ---

```text
docker build -t xkcd-pw .
```

 ---

```text
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/usr/src/app" xkcd-pw ./pw.pl
```

---

### 👋 Running from inside a container

```text
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/usr/src/app" xkcd-pw bash
```

---

### 🏃‍♀️ `docker run -it`

* `-i`              : Keep STDIN open even if not attached
* `-t`              : Allocate a pseudo-tty

You will often see `-i -t` written as `-it`

Note:

* When you see `tty`, think `terminal`. That word has a lot of history that is
  interesting to research, but beyond the scope of what we're covering here.

---

### 🔨 Building your own entrypoint images

`entrypoint-Dockerfile`

 ---

 <!-- :read slides/8-intro-to-docker/app/Dockerfile  -->

```Dockerfile
FROM perl:5.38

RUN cpm install -g Crypt::XkcdPassword

RUN mkdir /app

WORKDIR /app

COPY pw.pl .

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/pw.pl"]
```

Note:

* `WORKDIR`
  * sets the current working directory for the `COPY` command
  * is the directory you will be in when you
    * run the container
    * attach to the container

---

```text
docker build -f entrypoint-Dockerfile -t pw .
```

---

### 🧙 Easy incantation

```text
docker run pw
```

---

### 🤔 Peeking inside an entrypoint container

```text
docker run --rm -it pw bash
```

---

### 💡 Overriding an ENTRYPOINT

```text
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash pw
```

---

### 📈 Less is more

 <!-- :read slides/8-intro-to-docker/app/Dockerfile  -->

```Dockerfile
FROM perl:5.38

RUN cpm install -g Crypt::XkcdPassword

RUN mkdir /app

WORKDIR /app

COPY pw.pl .

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/pw.pl"]
```

---

### 😰 Oops

```text
Multiple consecutive `RUN` instructions. Consider consolidation
```

```Dockerfile
FROM perl:5.38

RUN cpm install -g Crypt::XkcdPassword && mkdir /app

WORKDIR /app

COPY pw.pl .

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/pw.pl"]
```

Note:

* Each `RUN` command creates a new layer. This can make your image bigger than
  it needs to be.
* Minimize your `RUN` commands to keep your image size down.

---

### 👀 Peeking inside an arbitrary container

```text
docker run --rm -it golang:latest bash
```

```text
root@870239ac7387:/go# go version
go version go1.22.1 linux/amd64

root@870239ac7387:/go# cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)"
NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="12"
VERSION="12 (bookworm)"
VERSION_CODENAME=bookworm
ID=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/"
```

Note:

* `latest` is a special Docker tag. Generally it will "do the right thing"
* By default, you are `root` when you log in to a running Docker container

---

### 🤐 Unzipping untrusted files

`untrusted.zip` is in our current directory


```text
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/app ruby:3.2.0-bullseye bash
```

Note:

* Spin up a fresh container with a volume mount of our current directory, so
  that zip file is available to the container

---

### 🚚 Move the File to a Directory which is not Shared with the Host

 ---

```bash
mkdir /sandbox && cd /sandbox && unzip /app/untrusted.zip
```

Note:

* This may not prevent every exploit, but it can be a lot cleaner than opening
  thousands of files into a directory on your filesystem.
* You can install an editor into the container if you like

---

### 😅 Deploying an application

```text
 docker run --rm -it     \
  -p 3000:3000           \
  -v $PWD:/sandbox       \
  ruby:3.2.0-bullseye bash
```

* `-p` / `--publish`
* `-p $host:$container`

Note:

* -p is the `publish` flag

---

### 🏃📦 List running containers

```text
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
66669b11657d   golang:latest   "bash"    5 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds             goofy_kepler
```

---

### ➕ Attach to a running container by id

```text
$ docker exec -it 66669b11657d bash
root@66669b11657d:/go#
```

---

### 📛 Attach to a running container by name

```text
$ docker exec -it goofy_kepler bash
root@66669b11657d:/go#
```

---

### 🛑 Stop a running container by id

```text
docker stop 66669b11657d
```

---

### 🛑 📛 Stop a running container by name

```text
docker stop goofy_kepler
```

---

### 🧪 Use cases for Docker (testing)

* Testing behaviour under a specific OS
* Testing behaviour under specific software versions
* A combination of the above

---

### Use cases for Docker (isolation)

* Installing dependencies on the guest leaves the host untouched
* Untrusted code can be more easily sandboxed

---

### 🧰 Use cases for Docker (tooling)

<https://github.com/oalders/geoip2-csv2pg>

* Download GeoIP2 CSV files and import them into a Pg database
  * You don't need `curl` installed locally
  * You don't need Linux running locally
  * You don't need Postgres installed locally

---

### 💼 Use cases for Docker (applications)

`metacpan/metacpan-web`

* Perl application
* Deployed locally -- ready to use

```text
docker run --rm -it -p5001:5001 metacpan/metacpan-web
```

In another terminal:

```text
open http://0:5001
```

---

### 🥳 Advantages of Docker

* If well configured, you don't have to install many (or any) dependencies
* If filing a bug ticket, you can include a Docker incantation to reproduce the bug

---

#### 🐞 Debugging a Rust Application

```text
$ gh repo clone houseabsolute/precious
$ cd precious

$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/precious rust:slim-buster bash
root@053303aac27e:/# rustc --version
rustc 1.71.0 (8ede3aae2 2023-07-12)
root@053303aac27e:/# cd precious && "do stuff"
 ```

Note:

* Now you have a Rust development environment without having to configure it
  locally
* I won't demonstrate it here because it takes far too long to download all of
  the dependencies.

---

#### 🐛 Debugging Go + Bash

##### Creating a Dockerfile

```text
touch Dockerfile
```

 ---

```Dockerfile
FROM bash:5.2.15

# https://stackoverflow.com/a/59485924/406224
COPY --from=golang:1.20-alpine /usr/local/go/ /usr/local/go/

ENV PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}"
```

 ---

```text
docker build -t bash-with-go .
```

Note:

* cd ./bash
* Multi-stage build
* Avoid multiple RUN statements

---

#### 🏃 Run the image with the app mounted

```text
$ gh repo clone JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh
$ cd oh-my-posh


$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/oh-my-posh bash-with-go bash

bash-5.2# cd oh-my-posh/src/
bash-5.2# go test ./...
```

---

#### Test driving the prompt 🏎️

![oh-my-posh prompt](img/oh-my-posh.png)

---

#### 🔎 Docker: The Missing Bits

* `docker run -d | --detach`
* `docker compose`

Note:

* Docker will start your container the same as before but this time will detach
  from the container and return you to the terminal prompt.

---

#### 🚀 Docker: The production deployment

* `docker swarm`
* just use k8s or k3s

---

#### 🏁 In Summary

* Always `--rm` unless debugging a container after shutdown
* Use `bash -c` if doing something requiring more than one statement
* Use Docker to avoid having to install a lot of dependencies
* Use `docker build` to allow others to replicate your issues
